		<h2>Believer</h2>
		<p>First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head <p/>
I'm fired up and tired of the way<p/>
That things have been, oh-ooh<p/>
The way that things have been, oh-ooh<p/>
Second things second<p/>
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<p/>
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh<p/>
The master of my sea, oh-ooh<p/>

I was broken from a young age<p/>
Taking my sulking to the masses<p/>
Writing my poems for the few<p/>
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<p/>
Singing from heartache from the pain<p/>
Taking my message from the veins<p/>
Speaking my lesson from the brain<p/>
Seeing the beauty through the<p/>

Pain!<p/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<p/>
Pain!<p/>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<p/>
Pain!<p/>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<p/>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<p/>
Pain!<p/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<p/>

Third things third<p/>
Send a prayer to the ones up above<p/>
All the hate that you've heard<p/>
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh<p/>
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh<p/>

I was choking in the crowd<p/>
Building my rain up in the cloud<p/>
Falling like ashes to the ground<p/>
Hoping my feelings, they would drown<p/>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<p/>
Inhibited, limited<p/>
Till it broke open and rained down<p/>
And rained down, like<p/>

Pain!<p/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<p/>
Pain!<p/>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<p/>
Pain!<p/>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<p/>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<p/>
Pain!<p/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<p/>

Last things last<p/>
By the grace of the fire and the flames<p/>
You're the face of the future<p/>
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<p/>
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<p/>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<p/>
Inhibited, limited<p/>
Till it broke open and rained down<p/>
And rained down, like<p/>
Pain!<p/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<p/>
Pain!<p/>
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<p/>
Pain!<p/>
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain<p/>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from<p/>
Pain!<p/>
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>

		<h2>Remember The Name</h2>
		<p>You ready? Lets go!<p/>
Yeah, for those of you that want to know what we're all about<p/>
It's like this y'all c'mon<p/>

It's just ten percent luck<p/>
Twenty percent skill<p/>
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will<p/>
Five percent pleasure<p/>
Fifty percent pain<p/>
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name<p/>

Mike<p/>
He doesn't need his name up in lights<p/>
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic<p/>
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone<p/>
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him<p/>
But fuck em'<p/>
He knows the code<p/>
It's all not about the salary<p/>
It's about reality and makin' some noise<p/>
Makin' the story<p/>
Makin' sure his clique stays up<p/>
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up<p/>

Who the hell is he anyway?<p/>
He never really talks much<p/>
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck<p/>
Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact<p/>
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin raps<p/>
Put it together himself, now the picture connects<p/>
Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect<p/>
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach<p/>
And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist<p/>

It's just twenty percent skill<p/>
Eighty percent fear<p/>
Be one hundred percent clear 'cause Ryu is ill<p/>
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames<p/>
And I heard him wreckin' with The Crystal Method, Name Of The Game<p/>
Came back dropped Megadef, took 'em to church<p/>
I'm like 'bleach, man, why you have the stupidest verse?'<p/>
This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin' him guest spots<p/>
His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin' with S-Dot!<p/>

It's just ten percent luck<p/>
Twenty percent skill<p/>
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will<p/>
Five percent pleasure<p/>
Fifty percent pain<p/>
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name<p/>

They call him Ryu the sick<p/>
And he's spittin fire at Mike<p/>
Got him out the dryer he's hot<p/>
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak<p/>
Been a fuckin' annihilist porcupine<p/>
He's a prick, he's a cock<p/>
The type woman want to be with<p/>
And rappers hope he get shot<p/>
Eight years in the makin'<p/>
Patiently waitin to blow<p/>
Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe<p/>
He's got a partner in crime his shit is equally dope<p/>
You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat<p/>

Tak<p/>
He's not your everyday on the block<p/>
He knows how to work with what he's got<p/>
Makin' his way to the top<p/>
People think its a common owners name<p/>
People keep askin him was it given at birth<p/>
Or does it stand for an acronym?<p/>
No he's livin' proof<p/>
Got him rockin' the booth<p/>
He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice<p/>
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best<p/>
Dedicated to what they doin give a hundred percent<p/>

Forget Mike<p/>
Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard<p/>
It seems like he's never got time<p/>
Because he writes every note and he writes every line<p/>
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind<p/>
It's like a design is written in his head every time<p/>
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme<p/>
And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed<p/>
Ridiculous, without even tryin', how do they do it?<p/>

It's just ten percent luck<p/>
Twenty percent skill<p/>
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will<p/>
Five percent pleasure<p/>
Fifty percent pain<p/>
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name<p/>

It's just ten percent luck<p/>
Twenty percent skill<p/>
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will<p/>
Five percent pleasure<p/>
Fifty percent pain<p/>
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name<p/>

Yeah<p/>

		<h2>Till I Collapse</h2>
		<p>Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak<p/>
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)<p/>
And when you feel weak (yo left)<p/>
You feel like you wanna just give up (yo left, yo left)<p/>
But you gotta search within you (right, left)<p/>
Try to find that inner strength (yo left, yo left)<p/>
And just pull that shit out of you (yo left)<p/>
And get that motivation to not give up (right, left, yo left)<p/>
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall<p/>
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)<p/>
Flat on your face and collapse<p/>

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em<p/>
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em<p/>
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not eminem<p/>
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?<p/>
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom<p/>
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop<p/>
Amoxicillin's just not real enough<p/>
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain<p/>
A minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners<p/>
You're comin' with me, feel it or not<p/>
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us<p/>
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock<p/>
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?<p/>
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up<p/>
You bizzles forgot, slizzle does not give a fuck<p/>

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out<p/>
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<p/>
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<p/>
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse<p/>
(Until the roof) 'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out<p/>
(The roof comes off) 'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<p/>
(Until my legs) 'til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<p/>
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse<p/>

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get<p/>
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit<p/><p/>
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend<p/>
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again<p/>
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can<p/>
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end<p/>
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in<p/>
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in<p/>
It goes reggie, jay-z, 2pac and biggie<p/>
André from outkast, jada, kurupt, nas, and then me<p/>
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy<p/>
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me<p/>
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me<p/>
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me<p/>
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me<p/>
The press's wet dream, like bobby and whitney — nate, hit me!<p/>

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out<p/>
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<p/>
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<p/>
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse<p/>
(Until the roof) 'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out<p/>
(The roof comes off) 'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<p/>
(Until my legs) 'til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<p/>
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse<p/>

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart<p/>
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart<p/>
And it's absurd how people hang on every word<p/>
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve<p/>
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved<p/>
If I ever leave earth, that would be the death of me first<p/>
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse<p/>
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse<p/>
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict<p/>
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm kim mathers<p/>
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles<p/>
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers<p/>
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em<p/>
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?<p/>
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm slim matters<p/>
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so<p/>

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out<p/>
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<p/>
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<p/>
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse<p/>
(Until the roof) 'til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out<p/>
(The roof comes off) 'til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<p/>
(Until my legs) 'til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<p/>
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse<p/>

Until the roof (until the roof)<p/>
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)<p/>
Until my legs (until my legs)<p/>
Give out from (underneath me)<p/>
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall<p/>
Feels like no one can beat me</p>
